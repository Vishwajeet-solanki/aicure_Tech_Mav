# Tech_Mav - AI Cure Project: PARSEC 4.0

## Introduction
In the AI Cure - PARSEC 4.0 challenge, our goal is to develop an advanced model capable of accurately predicting an individual's heart rate using ECG-derived features. This project uses a rich dataset encompassing diverse attributes measured through ECG recordings, aiming to predict heart rate at specific moments for each individual.

## Repository Contents
* **aicure-tech-mav-experiments.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing all experiments and the development process of our model.
* **aicure-Tech-mav.zip:** Zip folder containing trained model and python script for generating predictions on new data.
* **Report.txt:** Report on the research done to implement the solution.
* **README.md:** This file, containing project information and setup instructions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
### Installation
* Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Vishwajeet-solanki/aicure_Tech_Mav
```
### Usage

To predict heart rate using the run.py script, follow these steps:

* Place your '**test_data.csv**' in the project directory.

* Run the script:
```bash
  python run.py test_data.csv
```
* The script will create a '**results.csv**' file containing the predicted heart rates.
